6. Remove the tube of starter culture from the shaking platform in the 37°C incubator.

7. Pipette the starter culture into the Erlenmeyer flask of sterile LB that was made on Day 1. Cover the opening of the flask with aluminum foil.

8. Incubate on a shaking platform at 37°C. Measure the optical density periodically (see below).

*Phases of E.coli growth*
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

After the inoculation of the starter culture into the LB, the E.coli cells will grow rapidly at 37°C with shaking. There are various phases of growth, see Figure 4.

**Figure 4** The 4 phases of E.coli growth following inoculation

- *Lag phase* - the cell density increases slowly. If, for example, you inoculate 1L of LB from a single colony, you will see an extended lag phase. Using this protocol, you inoculate from a 10 mL starter culture so this phase will be relatively short lived.
 
- *Log phase* (also called the exponential phase) - the E.coli cells grow rapidly, or exponentially. The doubling time is approximately 20 minutes. This is the phase where the cells are healthiest and are actively producing proteins. Early- to mid- log phase is the ideal time to harvest the cells. 

- *Stationary phase* - the nutrients in the medium are depleted, metabolic products accumulate, and this stresses the cells and prevents their growth. 

- *Death phase* - excess metabolic products become toxic to the cells. The cells cannot be used to make competent cells and they are not good for protein production.

C.1 Measure the optical density (OD) of the *E.coli* cells.
-----------------------------------------------------------

You will measure the OD600 of the E.coli cells at various time intervals. OD600 is an abbreviation for the absorbance (optical density) of the cells in LB at a wavelength of 600 nm. This is a common method for measuring bacterial (or other) cells in a liquid.

**Figure 5** Standard spectrophotometer found in most molecular laboratories

#. Turn on the spectrophotometer.

#. Allow the spectrophotometer to warm up for 15 minutes before calibrating or running any samples.

   **Caution:** *You must recalibrate every time you change the wavelength.*

#. Set the wavelength to 600 nm and make sure the filter lever is at the appropriate position based on the wavelength.

#. To calibrate the spectrophotometer, ensure the sample compartment is empty. Using the 0%T knob (left one) change the data number to 0.00. Make sure the data value is on transmittance, if not, press the mode button until the red light by transmittance lights up.

#. Wearing gloves, get an empty cuvette and fill it to 3/4 with distilled water.

#. Wipe the sides of the cuvette using Kimwipes to ensure that there are no fingerprints.

#. Place the cuvette in a cuvette holder with the arrow facing outwards.

#. Place the cuvette holder in the sample compartment with the arrow facing the wavelength knob.

#. Turn the 100% T/OA knob (right one) until the data value on the screen shows 100.0 transmittance.

#. Remove the cuvette from the sample compartment. Do not turn the knobs anymore.

#. The spectrophotometer is now calibrated. You can now proceed with blanking and reading your sample by inserting solutions into the sample compartment and reading the absorbance.

#. Pipette 2 mL of uninoculated LB into the spectrophotometer cuvette. This is used as a reference blank. Blank the spectrophotometer using LB broth.

#. Every 30 minutes, pipette 2 mL of the growing culture into a clean cuvette and measure. Once the OD600 reaches 0.35-0.4, immediately place the cells on ice.

#. Cool the cell culture for 20-30 minutes. Gently and occasionally, swirl the flask.

**Caution:** *Do not let the OD go higher than 0.4. Check it regularly, particularly when it gets above 0.2 because the cells are growing exponentially at this stage. It usually takes approximately 3 hours to reach an OD of 0.35 if you are using a 10mL starter culture in 1L of LB. It is important that the cells are actively growing when they are harvested because this is when pores are present in the cell wall. The presence of these pores allows the formation of channels through which the DNA molecules can pass.*

D. Make competent *E.coli* cells
********************************

*What are competent cells?*
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Competent E.coli cells are more likely to incorporate foreign DNA if their cell walls are made more permeable so that DNA can pass through easily. Bacterial cells are naturally competent to a certain extent. They can be made artificially more competent in a laboratory when treated with calcium chloride (CaCl2) to make them transiently more permeable. The CaCl2 creates pores in the bacterial cell wall. The DNA is then forced into the cell using heat shock (at 42°C). This is the process of transformation.

If you perform a lot of transformations, making your own competent cells is more cost effective. The process is relatively simple and the cells can be made in bulk and snap frozen for later use. If, however you need a high efficiency of transformation, for example, if you are working with a low concentration of plasmid, you should purchase competent cells.

There are various methods and kits that can be used to make competent cells. In the following protocol, you will make E.coli cells competent using CaCl2. Adding CaCl2 to the cell suspension promotes the binding of the plasmid DNA to lipopolysaccharides in the inner core of the outer membrane of Gram negative bacteria, such as E.coli. Upon subsequent heat shock, the bound plasmid DNA can pass into the cell.

#. Place 4 x 250 mL centrifuge bottles on ice.
#. Split the 1L of bacterial culture into the ice cold centrifuge tubes.
#. Centrifuge at 3000 x g (~4000 rpm) in a Beckman JA-10 rotor for 15 minutes at 4°C.
#. Decant the supernatant and resuspend the bacterial pellet in 100 mL of ice cold MgCl2. 
#. Combine the suspensions into one bottle and prepare a balance bottle.
#. Harvest the cells by centrifugation at 2000 x g (~3000 rpm) in a Beckman JA-10 rotor for 15 minutes at 4°C.
#. Decant the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 200 mL of ice cold CaCl2. Keep this cell suspension on ice for 20 minutes.
#. Place 1.5 mL microfuge tubes on ice.
#. Harvest the cells by centrifugation at 2000 x g (~3000 rpm) in a Beckman JA-10 rotor for 15 minutes at 4°C.
#. Rinse a 50 mL conical tube with ddH2O and cool on ice.
#. Decant the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 50 mL of ice cold 85 mm CaCl2, 15% glycerol.
#. Transfer the suspension to the 50mL conical tube.

*************************************
E. Transform Competent *E.coli* cells
*************************************

The competent *E.coli* cells are heat shocked to assist the movement of the plasmid DNA into the cell. The heat shock changes the fluidity of the cell membrane allowing the DNA to enter the cell at an efficient rate. 

Another method commonly used is electroporation; however, this will not be dealt with here.

**Caution:** *Use sterile technique. You need to take precaution to not contaminate with bacteria or fungi from the air.*

E.1 Heat shock *E.coli* cells
=============================

#. Use the cells that you made competent in the previous step. If you prepared them previously and stored them in the -80°C freezer, then remove them from the freezer and thaw them on ice for approximately 30 minutes.

#. Remove the agar plates from 4°C so that they can come to room temperature. The agar plates should contain the correct percentage of the appropriate antibiotic, see Table 2. The resistance gene for the appropriate antibiotic is carried on the plasmid that will be transformed.

#. In a sterile microfuge tube, combine 1-5 µL of DNA (which should be between 10-100 pg) into 20-50 µL of competent cells. Mix the contents by flicking the tube with your finger. Incubate on ice for 30 minutes.

#. Heat shock the transformation tubes by placing the bottom half of the tubes into a 42°C water bath for 45 seconds.

#. Place the tubes on ice for 2 minutes.

#. Add 250-1000 µL of LB (without antibiotic) to the bacteria and grow in a 37°C shaking incubator for 45 minutes. This allows the bacteria time to generate the antibiotic resistance proteins so that they can grow once they are plated on the agar plates that contain antibiotic.

#. Plate some or all of the transformation onto an agar plate that contains the appropriate antibiotic. It is a good idea to plate a small amount (for example, 50 µL) onto one plate and the rest onto another plate. If the transformation was very efficient you are more likely to get single colonies on the plate containing 50 µL of the transformation mixture.

#. Incubate the plates at 37°C overnight.

*Invert the plates, so that if water condensation occurs, the water will collect on the plastic lid, not on the agar.
