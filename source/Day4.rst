Day 4

The next steps on Day 4 and 5 serve to verify that your *E.coli* bacteria cells were successfully transformed. You will do this by growing a large quantity of potentially transformed bacteria, extracting the plasmid, and verify the presence of the plasmid using agarose gel electrophoresis. This is a quick method, and various other methods are also commonly used; for example, sequencing and enzymatic digestion.

F.1 Growing potentially transformed bacteria

#. Remove the agar + antibiotic plates from the 37°C incubator and observe any growth. For further screening, you will use a single colony, so pick one that is separated from any other growth on the plate.

   *Each distinct colony represents an individual bacterial cell or group that has divided repeatedly. So, each colony is a mass of bacterial clones from a single 'mother' cell.* 

#. Working near a Bunsen burner and using a sterile inoculation loop, open the lid of the Petri dish. Touch the loop to a single colony.

#. Place the inoculated loop into 5 mL of LB (containing antibiotic) and gently swirl the loop in the broth to ensure you inoculate it.

#. Incubate the tube at 37°C overnight on a shaking platform.
